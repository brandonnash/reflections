Q. When would you want to create a remote repository instead of keeping all your work locally?
A. If i wanted to work from multiple work stations or if multiple people are contributing to one repository, also
this could be considered a backup even if i am working alone locally. 
Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. You may have a change your working on that isn't up to date in your remote yet, pulling would then effectively remove those changes. 
Q.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A. Fork is on github only, and makes a copy of someones repository with info linking back to the original, cloning is the same idea off of github without a link back to original, and branches are a totally seperate thing inside a repository that is seperate from master and allows things like new features to be added without disturbing the master branch keeping a working version of the program. You can then later merge those two branches together to add in the other new feature or whatnot from the other branch.
